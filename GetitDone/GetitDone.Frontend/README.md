**Getitdone.Frontend is a work in progress**

This document outlines the steps taken to develop a proof-of-concept user interface (UI) for the Getitdone application, using a generated TypeScript client. The UI is designed to demonstrate basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for projects and tasks. This document also details the issues encountered during development, particularly with browser compatibility and the generated client code.

**Project Structure**

The project is structured as follows:

```
GetitDone/
├── clients/
│   └── typescript/
│       ├── ... (TypeSpec client project files)
│       └── dist/
│           └── browser/
│               └── ... (browser-specific client output)
│           └── esm/
│               └── ... (ES module client output)
└── GetitDone.Frontend/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    └── script.js
```

*   **`clients/typescript`:** Contains the TypeSpec project and the generated TypeScript client code.
*   **`dist/browser`:** Contains the browser-specific output of the generated client.
*   **`dist/esm`:** Contains the ES module output of the generated client.
*   **`GetitDone.Frontend`:** Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the UI.

**Development Steps**

1.  **Generated TypeScript Client:**
    *   A TypeScript client was generated from a TypeSpec definition using the TypeSpec TypeScript emitter.
    *   The client provides a type-safe interface for interacting with the Getitdone REST API.
    *   The client is built using `npm install` and `npm run build` in the `clients/typescript` directory.

2.  **Frontend UI Setup:**
    *   **`index.html`:** Provides the basic HTML structure for the UI, including containers for projects and tasks, input fields, and buttons.
    *   **`style.css`:** Provides basic CSS styling for the UI.
    *   **`script.js`:** Contains the JavaScript logic for:
        *   Initializing the generated client.
        *   Fetching and displaying projects and tasks.
        *   Handling user interactions (button clicks, input changes).
        *   Updating the UI based on API responses.

3.  **JavaScript Logic (`script.js`):**
    *   **Import Client:** The `script.js` file imports the generated client from `../../clients/typecript/dist/browser/index.js`.
    *   **Client Initialization:** The client is initialized with the API endpoint: `http://localhost:5091`.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Vanilla JavaScript is used for DOM manipulation.
    *   **API Calls:** The client's methods are used to interact with the Getitdone API.
    *   **Functionality:** The UI supports the following:
        *   Displaying a list of projects.
        *   Selecting a project to view its tasks.
        *   Adding new projects and tasks.
        *   Deleting projects and tasks.
        *   Toggling task completion.

4.  **Web Server:**
    *   A web server is required to avoid CORS issues.
    *   **`http-server` is used with the command `http-server -p 8081` and is run from the root `GetitDone` directory.** This provides access to all project files.
    *   **The UI is accessed at `http://192.168.0.18:8081/GetitDone.Frontend/`.**

**Code Snippets**

*   **`script.js` (Import and Client Initialization):**

    ```javascript
    import createClient from '../../clients/typecript/dist/browser/index.js';

    const client = createClient({ endpoint: 'http://localhost:5091' });
    ```

*   **Example API Call (Fetching Projects):**

    ```javascript
    async function fetchProjects() {
        const response = await client.path('/projects').get();
        // ... handle response ...
    }
    ```

**Issues Encountered**

*   **Browser Compatibility:** The initial attempt to use the generated client in a browser environment failed due to direct imports from `@typespec/ts-http-runtime` in the generated `dist/browser` output.
*   **Missing `getClient` Implementation:** The generated browser code lacked a browser-specific implementation of the `getClient` function, which is essential for initializing the HTTP client.
*   **TypeSpec Emitter Bug:** The root cause of the issue was determined to be a bug in the TypeSpec TypeScript client emitter, which incorrectly generates browser code with direct module imports and a missing `getClient` implementation.

**Current State**

*   The basic UI structure and functionality are implemented.
*   The UI can display projects and tasks, add new projects and tasks, delete projects and tasks, and toggle task completion.
*   The UI is currently non-functional due to the TypeSpec emitter bug.
*   The bug has been reported to the TypeSpec team.

**Next Steps (When Bug is Fixed)**

1.  **Update Client:** After the TypeSpec bug is fixed, regenerate the TypeScript client.
2.  **Verify Browser Output:** Ensure that the generated `dist/browser` output no longer contains direct imports from `@typespec/ts-http-runtime` and includes a browser-specific implementation of `getClient`.
3.  **Test UI:** Test the UI in a browser environment to ensure that it functions correctly.
4.  **Enhance UI:** Add more features and improve the UI design as needed.

**Additional Notes**

*   The backend API is assumed to be running at `http://localhost:5091`.
*   The frontend code is located in the `GetitDone.Frontend` directory.
*   **`http-server` is used with the command `http-server -p 8081` and is run from the root `GetitDone` directory.**
*   **The UI is accessed at `http://192.168.0.18:8081/GetitDone.Frontend/`.**
