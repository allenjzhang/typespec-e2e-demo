# PetStore Express/Node.js project

This folder contains the PetStore Express/Node.js API server project generated from the [PetStore TypeSpec](../../spec/main.tsp) specification.

## Steps to re-create the executable server project

The TypeSpec HTTP Server Generator for JavaScript outputs code that can be used with Express/Node.js. Some manual steps are required to create a runnable project.

This folder contains a template project that implements the methods of the PetStore API by throwing `Not implemented` errors. For more information about how to
use the code generated by the HTTP Server Generator and the options it supports, see the [TypeSpec HTTP Server Generator for JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/tree/main/packages/http-server-javascript) README.

## Running the server

To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

1. Build the project:

```sh
npm run build
```

1. Start the server:

```sh
npm start
```

1. Try some requests:

You can use any client tool to send requests to the server. For example, you can use `curl`:

```sh
# List pets in the resource
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/pets
```
